Integrate WP Grid Builder with Meta Box plugin.

== Description ==

= WP Grid Builder - Meta Box =

This add-on adds support for Meta Box plugin. WP Grid Builder natively works with WordPress custom fields.
However, if you use a dedicated custom fields plugin like Meta Box, the values may be stored in such a way that they require additional processing to properly filter the content.

This add-on supports all field types generated by Meta Box plugin and makes it easy to filter content, regardless of field complexity.
For example, you can filter by a cloneable multiple select field placed in a group.

**Key Features:**

* Easily filter by any type of field from Meta Box
* Display field values in cards from custom field block

== Changelog ==

= 1.1.0 - October 1, 2024 =

* Added    Support for Map facet marker custom fields.

= 1.0.0 - April 29, 2021 =

* Initial release \o/
