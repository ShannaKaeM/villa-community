# USING THEME.JSON WITH WINDPRESS

Theme.json is a special file that works great with WindPress and Tailwind CSS. Let's learn how they work together!

## What is Theme.json?

Theme.json is like a recipe book for your website's look. It holds all your:
- Colors
- Spacing sizes
- Font sizes
- Border styles
- And more!

It keeps all these design choices in one place, making it easy to change how your whole site looks.

## How WindPress Uses Theme.json

WindPress is super smart! It can read your theme.json file and turn all those design choices into Tailwind CSS classes.

Here's what happens:
1. You put your design choices in theme.json
2. WindPress reads this file
3. WindPress creates Tailwind CSS classes for each design choice
4. You use these classes in your HTML

## Example: Using Colors from Theme.json

Let's say your theme.json has these colors:

```json
{
  "colorPrimary": "#9D3C72",
  "colorSecondary": "#5D8A8C",
  "colorAccent": "#C4A587"
}
```

With WindPress, you can use these colors like this:

```html
<div class="bg-colorPrimary text-colorSecondary border-colorAccent">
  This box uses your theme colors!
</div>
```

## How to Connect Theme.json to WindPress

The connection happens automatically! WindPress looks for your theme.json file in your theme folder.

If you want to be extra sure, you can tell WindPress where to find your theme.json in the main CSS file:

```css
@theme "../theme.json";
```

## Benefits of Using Theme.json with WindPress

1. **One Source of Truth**: All your design tokens are in one file
2. **Easy Updates**: Change a color once, it updates everywhere
3. **WordPress Native**: Works with WordPress's own systems
4. **No Duplication**: No need to copy design tokens to multiple places
5. **Better Teamwork**: Designers can update the theme.json file without touching code

## Our Theme.json Structure

Our theme.json file is organized into sections:

1. **Global Colors**: Basic color palette (color1, color2, etc.)
2. **Semantic Colors**: Colors with meaning (colorPrimary, colorAccent, etc.)
3. **Background Colors**: Colors for different backgrounds
4. **Text Colors**: Colors for different text elements
5. **Spacing**: Standard spacing sizes
6. **Typography**: Font sizes and styles

## Using Our Theme.json with WindPress

With our setup, you can use classes like:

- `bg-colorPrimary` - Background with primary color
- `text-textColor` - Text with main text color
- `p-spacingMd` - Padding with medium spacing
- `text-fontSizeLg` - Text with large font size
- `rounded-radiusMd` - Border radius with medium size

This makes it super easy to build consistent designs that match our theme!
