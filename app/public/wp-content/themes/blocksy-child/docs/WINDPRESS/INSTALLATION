Installing WindPress is super easy! Here's how to do it in simple steps.

## Before You Start

### Step 3: Install It
- Click the blue "Install Now" button next to WindPress
- Wait a few seconds for it to download

### Step 4: Turn It On

## What Happens Next?

After you install WindPress:

1. You'll see a new "WindPress" item in your WordPress dashboard menu
2. Click on it to see the WindPress settings
3. You can start using Tailwind CSS classes right away in your content

## Using WindPress with Our Theme

Our theme works great with WindPress because:

1. We have a theme.json file with all our design tokens
2. WindPress reads this file automatically
3. You can use all our theme colors and settings as Tailwind classes

For example, if our theme.json has a color called "colorPrimary", you can use the class "bg-colorPrimary" to make a background that color.
