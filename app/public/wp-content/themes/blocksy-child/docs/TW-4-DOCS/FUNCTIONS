Tailwind CSS Functions and Directives: Simple Guide
Tailwind CSS has special words that help you make your website look nice. These are called "functions" and "directives." Let's learn about them!

What are Directives?
Directives are special commands that start with @ (like @theme or @apply). They tell Tailwind to do something special with your CSS.

Important Directives to Know
@theme
This is like a treasure box for your colors, sizes, and fonts!

css
CopyInsert
@theme {
  --color-blue: #0000ff;
  --font-big: 24px;
  --space-small: 8px;
}
When you use @theme, Tailwind will automatically make classes like:

bg-color-blue (for blue backgrounds)
text-font-big (for big text)
p-space-small (for small padding)
@import
This helps you bring in other CSS files:

css
CopyInsert
@import "tailwindcss";
@apply
This lets you use Tailwind classes inside your own CSS:

css
CopyInsert
.my-button {
  @apply rounded-lg bg-blue-500 text-white p-4;
}
@utility
This helps you make your own utility classes:

css
CopyInsert
@utility tab-4 {
  tab-size: 4;
}
@variant
This lets you change styles for different states:

css
CopyInsert
.my-element {
  background: white;
  @variant dark {
    background: black;
  }
}
How This Helps Your Project
With these special words, you can:

Keep all your colors and sizes in one place
Make your own classes that work like Tailwind's
Change how things look when you hover or click
Use the same style in many places without copying code
This makes your website easier to build and change later!
